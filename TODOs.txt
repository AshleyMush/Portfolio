Remove register.html once deployed. Remove register article from index.html.

1) Fix the bug where the form in get_project is not being submitted.
2) Fix bug where the user can get_project and if they are authenticated, they should not see the login form or the register form. They should see the add project form.
-What is the admin dashboard privilleges
  -add project
  -delete project
  -login
    -register once only
    -patch project
    -logout

 if user gets all projects they should be redirected to url_for('home')
 if user gets a project they should be redirected to url_for('home')
 #---
 if user logs in they should be redirected to url_for('admin_home')
 The url_for('admin_home') should render the admin_home.html which extends index.html
 in the admin should NOT have the ability to register, they should only be able to login
